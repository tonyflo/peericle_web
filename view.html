<blockquote>We're going to get big waves in a few days and everybody is going to barf all over the place.  My floats are up in the container, hopefully they won't get wet.  My Salinometer is broken.  Why did it break again.  Clindor's eyes are not blue, Nick is a liar.  I like watching bubbles.  Nick told me he'd sweep the floor in my lab, isn't that nice of him.  Is that enough bullshit text for you, Nick?
